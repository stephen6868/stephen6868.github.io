                <h2 id="historyH">History of Hot Beans Web</h2>
                <p id="hp">In the late 1991 in August our founder and CEO at the time had a dream that one day all people on the earth
                    could create a website, and so decided to, 20 years later create Hot Beans Web. Our CEO created this website all by himself
                    but as the website grew he began to hire more and more people to help, however in late 2020 he unfortunately died of Covid-19. Which leads on to
                    our new current CEO President Xavier Smith.
