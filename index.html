            <h2>What is a sensible website?</h2>
            <p>A sensible website, is a website that is considered subjectively as well as objectively acceptable. For<br>
                those viewing that website. It needs to be acceptable for all people to view the website.This means<br>
                that anyone who vsit that website will not think it is inappropiate. There needs to be general consensus<br>
                among people to make something be objective, until there is a uniting census, a website will be subjective.
